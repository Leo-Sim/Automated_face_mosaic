# Automated Face Mosaic

This project automatically detects faces in video footage using a combination of object detection and face recognition technologies. It performs real-time face tracking and applies mosaic (pixelation) over detected faces for privacy protection.

The system uses:

- **YOLO** for fast and accurate face detection
- **ArcFace** for robust face feature embedding and identity tracking
- **SORT** (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) for temporal tracking across video frames
- **OpenCV** for video frame handling and mosaic effect rendering

| `export_path`    | Directory path to save the trained YOLO model.                  | `".src/model"`        |


## ðŸ§ª Sample Execution Result

The image below is a sample frame captured during video playback, demonstrating the output of the automatic face recognition and mosaic system.

- The **green box** indicates a face that was automatically **detected** by the model and subsequently **blurred**.
- The **smiling emoji** was **manually added** to cover a **non-target face**, which was intentionally **excluded from automatic processing** for privacy reasons.
